## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Tailwind
- Mobile-first workflow
- OOP
- Vite(yarn)

### What I learned

I am proud of my experience with APIs, honing my skills, and working on a project overall. Several months ago, it would have taken me much more time to finish this.

### Continued development

Working with setters and the OOP environment is still challenging for me, and there’s a lot I still need to learn. I’m also not yet comfortable with APIs, and I find TypeScript to be strict and demanding.

So how did I overcome these challenges? I kept trying—writing, deleting, and trying again. I took breaks when needed and made sure to read the relevant documentation.
